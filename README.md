# Object-Detection-using-OpenCV
This is a simple object detection code that was writen in PyCharm using OpenCV. It has a configuration file used in the mobile SSD and a weights file as well. ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt is the configuration file whcih you can import while writting the code and frozen_inference_graph_pb is the weights file. Although keep in mind that these files need to be downloaded first which can be done by a simple web search. The coco_names is a file that contains a long list of objects which will help our device detect the objects, this file can also be found easily on the web. 
This code is one of the easiest when looking for object detction in Python and has simple steps.
